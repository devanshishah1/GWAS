# GWAS Interactive Manhattan Plot 

This project creates an interactive Manhattan plot for visualizing Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) results using Plotly in Python. A Manhattan plot is a scatter plot commonly used to display significant associations between genetic variants (SNPs) and traits or diseases. The plot is interactive, allowing users to hover over data points and explore p-values and other related information in a visually appealing format
